# Fraud-Detection-Pipeline-Using-Azure-Databricks


## Platform: Python, Machine Learning, Big Data, PySpark, SparkSQL, Azure Blob Storage, Azure Databricks, Power BI



## The objective of this project was to build a fraud detection pipeline to identify fraudulent banking transactions. Data from Azure Blob Storage was processed in Azure Databricks, where it underwent data selection,validation and transformation.   A supervised machine learning model was employed to classify fraud, with insights visualized through Power BI dashboard. The project aimed to improve fraud detection accuracy, streamline processes, and provide actionable insights to help banks reduce fraudulent activities.
